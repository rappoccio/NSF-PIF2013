\section{Funding Strategy}

This research proposal outlines the necessity to extend the computing
capacity of the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in
Geneva, Switzerland, to the exascale of high-throughput
processing. This is an enormously challenging task, but a necessary
one to ensure the long-term success of the LHC experiments. 

Exascale computing (in this case, in high throughput)
is an enormously growth-oriented area. Even during
lean economic times, the US Federal Government is pledging to support
this area of research, for instance in the Department of Energy
Exascale Computing Initiative~\cite{doe_eci}. Indeed, the DOE Office of
Science quotes :
\begin{quote}
The Exascale initiative will be significant and transformative for Department of Energy missions.
\end{quote}
The current level of funding for the DOE EIC and related activities is
\$21M.~\cite{doe_eci_budget}. This ``transformative'' strategy is one
that is envisioned to continue well into the future. 
In addition to DOE programs, the
National Science Foundation (NSF) has several programs to address the
problems of high-throughput exascale computing~\cite{nsf1,nsf2}.

In addition to governmental programs such as above, private sector
funding sources are also available, such as the Google Faculty
Research Awards~\cite{google_fac_awards}, which has an interest in
exascale computing projects also. 

We plan to apply for these projects in the coming year 2013-2014.

\section{Narrative}

With the discovery of the Higgs boson 
by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
experiments ATLAS and CMS~\cite{higgs_cms,higgs_atlas}, the
standard model (SM) of particle
physics is now complete. This model unifies the electromagnetic force
(carried by the {\em photon}) with the weak force, responsible for
radioactive decay (carried by the {\em $W$ and $Z$ bosons}).
At long last,
physicists now understand that via interactions with the Higgs field,
the $W$ and $Z$ bosons acquire a mass, but the photon does not. 
This is referred to as ``electroweak symmetry breaking''. 


A new phase of particle physics has therefore begun. 
The questions have shifted from the cause of electroweak symmetry
breaking, to the study of the Higgs boson and its interactions in
detail. 
To understand the larger picture of the fundamental forces in nature,
the past excellence of the LHC experiments must therefore continue
unabated in the face of new technical challenges. 


One of the major technical challenges that lies ahead is the
continuation of the scaling of computational power year by year, known
colloquially as ``Moore's Law''. 
To set the scale, at the CMS experiment
with the LHC collision flux (``luminosity'') reaching
$7\instlumiA$, the processing
time to reconstruct each collision event by CMS was approximately 20
seconds per event. However, as the luminosity is
increased, the computational time currently scales quadratically. As
the upgraded LHC is expected to deliver $>12\instlumiA$ in the
upcoming run, the processing time per event is expected to reach
several minutes per event as shown in
Figure~\ref{lumitpeSingleMu}. Furthermore, in future runs of the LHC
in the next 15 years, the luminosity is expected to reach as high as
$>1\instlumiB$, which would correspond (naively) to several hours of
computational time per event! Clearly, it is necessary for the
computing power to scale in order to compensate for this dramatic
increase in CPU time with increasing luminosity. 



However, with the expected end of the historic scaling of single-core
processing capability~\cite{GAMEOVER}, it is imperative to utilize a
parallel processing
strategy in order to maintain the levels of computational speed that
are required.

Oftentimes,
the codes used by CMS (and experimental HEP in general) tend to lack
clear numerical ``kernels'' where optimization efforts can be focused. 
Given these characteristics they are generally more properly classified as
``high throughput computing'' (HTC) rather than ``high performance computing'' (HPC). 
In terms of their detailed behavior on the CPU many of these codes resemble
more general enterprise or ``cloud''
applications~\cite{CLOUDSUITE,GOODACHEP}.

However, there are several numerical algorithms where parallelization
could be exploited more directly. One of these is the so-called ``jet
clustering'' algorithms used at CMS, which we now discuss in detail. 
%At CMS, this computation is done very often by individuals rather than
%centrally, and so is accounted for
%in the 40\% of CPU usage from ``mixed user analysis applications'' as
%described above. 
%It is likely, therefore, that improvements observed
%in jet clustering will primarily benefit this portion of the CPU
%usage. 
%We now discuss the prospects for
%utilizing parallelization in jet clustering in detail. 

 

\subsection{Jet Clustering} 




The energetic deposits of particles in detectors need to be clustered
to obtain the
complete response. This is because the process
inherently involves a shower of particles called a ``jet''. This
``jet clustering'' is a well-established technique employed at
many different particle physics experiments worldwide, and is
implemented in a common software framework called 
{\tt fastjet}~\cite{fastjet_manual}. 
The mathematical problem is analogous to the
``K-nearest neighbors algorithm''~\cite{knn_ieee} (kNN). 
The single-core optimization of
jet clustering
is outlined in Ref.~\cite{fastjet_timing}. In a single core,
the computational time scales as $O(N^2)$ or  $O(N \ln{N})$, where $N$
is the number of inputs to the algorithm, which scales linearly with
luminosity. 

There is existing work and literature on the topic of the
parallelization of the kNN algorithm, for instance, in
Refs.~\cite{knn_gpu_1, knn_gpu_2, knn_gpu_3}, where improvements
$O(100)$ in CPU performance are observed over standard
algorithms. Since the proposed use case is
very similar to the kNN algorithm, similar improvements to the
processing time by parallelization strategies are expected. 

We now discuss specific strategies that can be developed 
to optimize performance in this algorithm.

      instantaneous luminosity.}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Full Stack Parallelization}

To achieve the necessary improvements in performance required for scalability
of jet clustering, we propose to examine parallelization opportunities across
the entire software stack, including three specific areas : 
(1) the use of lightweight concurrency
extraction to mask high-latency computations or I/O actions, 
(2) extraction of
parallelization from the computation itself in the form of optimistic speculation
and specialized transform, and
(3) new methods for distributing the computation to
maximize parallelization on each node. 


\bigskip
\noindent
{\bf  Lightweight Concurrency for Latency Masking}
\bigskip

Many mathematical kernels contain opportunities for extracting ``micro parallelism,''
usually on the order of tens of instructions, from their computational components. 
Unfortunately, it is very difficult to parallelize this computation profitably as
the overhead of thread creation, scheduling, synchronization, and migration outweigh
the gains in parallelism. Instead of extracting explicit parallelism from such
computations, we propose to explore methods of lightweight asynchrony to allow for
computation to proceed while waiting on high latency I/O operations to complete or
the results of other computations. Since the creation of threads and associated
schedule and synchronization costs are typically prohibitive, we will explore new
threading models that allow for logically-distinct computations to execute within
a given construct. The PIs previous research has indicated that such schemes can profitably
boost overall performance in the context of ML code~\cite{acml, parasites}. 
%The salient research
%challenges in applying this strategy are as follows:  1) identifying what computation can be executed
%safely during high latency operations at compile time, 2) providing a lightweight threading runtime
%and programming model in the context of an imperative language, 
%3) specializing the approach to numeric kernels,
%and 4) building support for computation in a distributed setting.

\bigskip
\noindent
{\bf Speculative Computation}
\bigskip

In addition to exploring explicit parallelization of the numeric kernels in jet clustering, we
propose to explore extraction of parallelism via speculative computation. At its core, speculative
computation breaks apart sequential or parallel tasks into smaller tasks to be run in parallel. Once
the speculation has completed, the runtime system validates the computation. If the computation is
incorrect ({\em i.e.} a ``datarace'' is detected, the computation cannot be serialized, {\em etc.}), the
incorrect computation is re-executed in a non-speculative manner.  If the rate of mis-speculation
is low, such techniques can be leveraged to extract additional
parallelism. 
%There have been many different
%proposals, including large efforts on transactional memory~\cite{},
%lock elision~\cite{}, thread level speculation and speculative
%multithreading~\cite{},
% for integrating speculative computation into programming languages
% and their associated runtimes~\cite{}.
The PIs have extensive experience with transactional memory~\cite{trans}, lightweight rollback methods~\cite{stab}, 
leveraging memoization to reduce re-computation costs~\cite{memo1, memo2},
and deterministic speculation~\cite{iso}. We propose to explore a specialized speculation framework leveraging different
speculation strategies, including speculation extracted by the programmer via programming language primitives,
library level speculation, and compiler extracted speculation.
%The salient research
%challenges in applying this strategy are as follows:  1) identification the appropriate speculation model and
%discovering speculation points at compile time, 2) providing a speculative runtime specialized for jet clustering
%and capable of realizing user, library, and compiler injected speculation, and 3) exploring new and specialized
%lightweight validation and re-execution mechanisms, including validation across multiple speculation strategies.



\bigskip
\noindent
{\bf Smart Distribution}
\bigskip

In order to increase parallelism, we will explore the use of the MapReduce
execution framework~\cite{mapreduce-osdi, mapreduce-hadoop}. MapReduce is a
runtime system recently developed for large-scale parallel data processing. It
enables programmers to easily deploy their applications on a cluster of
machines. Programmers only need to write two functions, Map and Reduce, and
submit these two functions as a job to the system. Then the MapReduce framework
takes care of all the aspects of the execution of the job. For example, the
framework packages and distributes the two functions over the cluster so that
the whole cluster can be utilized to execute the job; it also takes care of
fault-tolerance by monitoring the cluster during the execution of the job and
redistributes the job if some machine fails.

Due to this simplicity and power, it is quickly gaining popularity in industry
for large-scale data processing. Many applications in scientific computing have not
yet explored the use of MapReduce in depth, however
previous research has explored implementing kNN with
MapReduce~\cite{knn-mapreduce-0, knn-mapreduce-1}. We intend to explore this
question in the context of jet clustering for the LHC.

\subsection{Summary}

In summary, the problem of expanding LHC computing to the exascale is
a difficult, but tractable one. This proposal investigates the
possibility of applying cutting-edge parallelization techniques such
as lightweight concurrency extraction, speculative computation, and
smarter distribution, to the
real-world application of LHC data processing.
The overall goal is to reduce the computational time for
$k$-nearest-neighbor-like numerical kernels used for jet
clustering. The investigators of this
proposal have extensive experience in the various aspects of the
problem, and the synergistic application of this experience is
expected to attain considerable improvements in this area, which
are absolutely critical to the success of the future LHC physics
program.
